🚀Power BI Sales Dashboard | End-to-End Data Analysis Project (2024–2025)

 I created an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI, focusing on end-to-end data cleaning, modeling, and visualization. This dashboard helps track key business metrics and provides a clear view of sales performance across products, categories, and regions.

🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:


 ✅ Total Sales: 15M

 ✅ Total Orders: 200

 ✅ Average Order Value: 75.43K

 ✅ Total Quantity Sold: 590

 ✅ Top-selling categories: Electronics & Accessories

 ✅ Highest-performing region: East & North (~26%)

 ✅ Top 5 customers contributing highest sales

🛠️ What I Used:

1. Power BI (DAX, Measures, Data Modeling)
2. Power Query for data cleaning
3. KPI Cards, Bar/Line/Pie Visuals
4. Region, Category & Product-wise analysis

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis, visualization, KPIs, and reporting.
